# Perceptron

This project was realized during the **Artificial Intelligence Tools** course at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.

## About the Project

The Perceptron program classifies irises into one of three species: **Iris setosa**, **Iris virginica**, or **Iris versicolor**.
It uses training data from a text file to train the perceptron model and tests its accuracy on test data. The results show the percentage of correctly classified vectors.

Key features include:
- A keyboard interface allowing users to input test vectors and receive classification results.
- A file-based interface that reads test data from a file and returns the percentage of correctly classified vectors.
- This program includes two perceptron models:
  1. The first checks whether a vector belongs to a selected class (in this case, Iris setosa).
  2. If not, the second perceptron classifies the vector into one of the remaining classes (Iris virginica or Iris versicolor).
